# Climbing Hold Segmentation

## Overview
This project focuses on segmenting climbing holds on a climbing wall using machine learning models. The project includes a Streamlit application for visualizing the segmentation and a Jupyter notebook for training and evaluating the model.

## Files
1. **`app/main.py`**: A Streamlit application for uploading climbing wall images, detecting holds, and generating climbing routes.
2. **`final_project_hold_segmentation.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook for preparing the dataset, training a U-Net model, and evaluating the model's performance.
